# Election_Analysis
## Prject Overview
We were given a the task of auditing a recent congressional election, there were five aspects of the results that we were asked to determine.
  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
  2. Compile a list of candidates for whom votes were cast.
  3. Determine the number of votes each candiadate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Resources
 - Data Source: election_results.csv
 
 - Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.71.2
 
 ## Summary
 Our Analysis of the election data show that:
 - There were 369,711 total votes cast
 - Three candidates received votes
      - Raymon Anthoany Doane
      - Charles Casper Stockham 
      - Diana Degette
      
- The County with the largest turnout was Denver with over 82% of the total votes cast.

- The percentage of votes received by each candidate were
    - Raymon Anthony Davis recevied 11,606 votes earning 3.1% of the total
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes earning 23.0% of the total
    - Diana Degette received 272,892 votes earning 73.8% of the total votes cast.
    
 - The winner of the election was:
    - Diana Degette, with a clear majority of the overall votes and percentage.
    
## Election Audit Summary
Thank you for the oportunity to examine the election data and get you the results you asked for. This program and code can be expanded to include a much larger dataset that might be useful to you in the future. Because the code automatically adds the individual county names, and the vote recipients names it will easily acoomodate a larger data set. By adding additional output variables we can slo track other aspects that might prove useful as well. I would love the chance to explore with you how the code could be used in your election process in the future.

 ## Challenge Overview
I found this challenge to be particularly interesting, creating both a list and dictionary to reference throughout the code gives us the ability to break down large data sets into useful pieces. Also, we will be able to use this method with expanded lists and dictionaries to include much larger amounts of data contained in each row of a .csv file and still be able to efficiently process the data. 

In the module challenge, re-using code, similar to how we displayed the candidates names along with their vote counts and percentages to show the county with the highest turnout was challenging for me. I was confident in my logic, but was utilizing the wrong variable and it was returning the incorrect result. This brought into sharp focus the need to use concise descriptive variables.

Using a code editor to open and create additonal files is an interesting excercise as well. Producing a useful document that can be updated based on a current dataset is useful when the new data is added regularly. In my experience as a sales manager, we were constantly looking for more efficient methods of updating our sales information and compiling it into simple and readable documents, so I know first hand how useful these techniques will be.

## Challenge Summary
I am looking forward to the next set of challenges and using the skills from this set to build on. I really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of this module and the technical skills that we learned. I can see how this module will build into a larger set of skills that are useful and satisying! Especially as we move into pandas and jupyter. The ability to run each piece of code and view it as smaller part of the overall really helps me to understand the process more clearly.
